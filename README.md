# Wayang Dataset

This dataset is designed for educational and research purposes, focusing on the classification and study of Wayang characters. This dataset was collected with crawling on Google Images and Pinterest platform. It includes **8 categories** representing characters from the **Pandawa Lima** and **Punakawan**, namely:

- **Yudhistira**  
- **Bima**  
- **Arjuna**  
- **NakulaSadewa**  
- **Semar**  
- **Gareng**  
- **Petruk**  
- **Bagong**  

The NakulaSadewa is in one category due to its twin genetics, so the shape and any feature would be very similar.
Each category contains **100 images** that have been preprocessed for consistency. The images are:  
- **Resized** to a standard resolution.  
- **Background removed**, isolating the characters for better feature extraction and analysis.  

This dataset is ideal for tasks such as:  
- Image classification  
- Feature extraction studies (e.g., shape, texture, color)  
- Machine learning and deep learning model training
